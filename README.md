Detecting and locating irises and pupils in a video file that only shows the eye area of the face can be achieved using computer vision techniques. One popular approach is to use a combination of face detection and eye region localization. OpenCV is a powerful library for computer vision tasks in Python, and it provides pre-trained models for face and eye detection.
